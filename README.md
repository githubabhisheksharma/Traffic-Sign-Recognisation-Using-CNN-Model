# Traffic-Sign-Recognisation-Using-CNN-Model
Traffic Sign Recognition Is One of the Most popular Technology that we implemented in order to reduce the road Accident in case of self driven car , We have Created a GUI Application Using Python Language And Used the Concept of Convolutional Neural Network To Train the Model using different Types of Traffic Signs &amp; feeded Such Images as Input to the System, Which Takes the Images and Compare it All The Images That are in the Trained Dataset Model Either Through Shapes or Based On Color Accordingly The System Provides Output To the External World I Am Leading the Entire Team Members &amp; Gathering The Images To Trained the CNN Model Preparing Datasets of Images Software: Pycharm Software to Writing the Python Code &amp; Python Packages (T-Kinter|Django) to Create GUI &amp; Datasets Model.
